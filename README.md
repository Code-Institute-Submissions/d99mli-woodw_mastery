# Woodworking Mastery - An online community - 
Milestone Project 3 by Mikael Lindberg

## Introduction
My aim is to create a member based community of like minded woodworkers that want to inspire and get inspired by awesome projects. To create a space where members learn together. To share their experiences, link to great videos (on youtube) and tools they have found to be indispensible in their workshop.

## Plagiarism alert
At the time of first deployment, 2021-09-20, it is still a copy of the mini project "Task Manager" project, not yet adapted to my vision of the MS3. When finished it will still use Task Manager as a base template but will be fully adapted. Code parts still left from the mini project will be clearly described here within as well in individual code files.

## UX

## User Stories
I love watching woodworking videos on youtube, however it is hard finding the gems worth watching, and the subscription page gets overloaded with all the saved channels.
